        <h1>Hot Pocket Fundraiser</h1>
        <p>
            In 2012 one of my co-workers (you know who you are) left a Hot Pocket 
            (with crisper) in the microwave for <em>way</em> too long. The result 
            was both hilarious and disaserous (the area by the microwave, which I 
            happen to sit directly by, reeked of smoke for days). All in all it was 
            pretty impressive.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Let's burn some Hot Pockets <br/> (and raise money for charity)</h2>
        <p>
            Families shouldn't have to decide between paying the rent and buying food. 
            The <a href="http://www.midohiofoodbank.org/">Mid-Ohio Food Bank</a> 
            provides emergency food assistance to more than
            248,000 individuals, including 86,975 children and 17,395 
            seniors<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
            To that end, I'll give you what you want to see Internet - I'll 
            microwave that hotpocket. I'll microwave the crap out of 
            it<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> and video tape it for you and upload it 
            on the internet.            
        </p>
        

        <h2>The catch</h2>
        <p>
            For every $50 I raise I'll microwave that Hot Pocket, in it's toaster 
            sleeve, for one minute. So $250 = 5 minutes (= <em>booooring</em>), but 
            $1,000 = 20 minutes (= guaranteed fun time).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Let the good times roll</h2>
        <p>
            I have to accept the fact that eventually what will be left will not 
            be so much a Hot Pocket per se, but more of a Hot Pocket shaped 
            lump of char. Microwaving something that's already burned up 
            is pretty boring so I'll offer some bonus material at the 
            follwing fundraising levels:
        </p>
        
        <h3>$1,000 - Guaranteed Burn</h3>
        <p>
            By hook or by crook I <em>will</em> make that Hot Pocket burn.
        </p>

        <h3>$1,500 - Double Down</h3>
        <p>
            Second footage, this time I'll wrap the Hot Pocket in 
            aluminum foil.
        </p>

        <h3>$2,000 - Super Double Down</h3>
        <p>
            Second run will be packed with gunpowder and wrapped in 
            aluminum foil.
        </p>

        <h3>$2,500 - Historical Reinactment</h3>
        <p>
            We'll film a reinactment of the original incident.
        </p>

        <h3>$3,000 - Alt-History Reinactment</h3>
        <p>
            Reinactment will be done with superhero costumes.
        </p>

        <h3>$50,000 - New Tattoo</h3>
        <p>
            I'll get a burning Hot Pocket tattooed on my 
            ass<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. That's right internet I will get 
            a Hot Pocket in flames tattooed on my butt. I'll document the process 
            and upload it for you to see<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>.
