            <h3>You said something about food?</h3>
            <p>
                I love to cook and consequently look for reasons to make good 
                food. Potential menu could include things like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Homemade bread</li>
                        <li>5 cheese Mac & Cheese</li>
                        <li>Sous Vide pulled pork</li>
                        <li>Roast Beef</li>
                        <li>The best amaretto<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                        sour you'll ever have<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

                    but no, your kids can't have an amaretto sour
